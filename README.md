# DayOrNight-MinimalProjrct
This project detects whether an image was taken during the day or night using  OpenCV and image processing. It converts the image to the HSV color model and analyzes the V (Value) channel, which represents brightness. If the average brightness is above a threshold, it's classified as day; otherwise, it's night. ðŸš€ðŸŒžðŸŒ™
